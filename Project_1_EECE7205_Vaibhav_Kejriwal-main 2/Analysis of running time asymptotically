 Analysis of running time asymptotically:

The time complexity of the â€œcases" function is O(n^2), as there is a nested loop from n-1 to m-1,
and each iteration takes O(n) time.

The time complexity of the "max_min_grouping" function is O(n), as there is a single loop from 1 to n.

As n tends to infinity, the time complexity of the max_min_grouping function becomes O(n^2).

The main function has a time complexity of O(n), as it has a loop from 1 to n.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2).
